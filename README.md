# Instagram-Fake-Profile-Detector
Building and training a simple artificial neural network model to detect spam/fake Instagram accounts.

In social media, fake and spam accounts are a huge issue. Many social media influencers establish phony Instagram profiles to give the appearance of having a large number of followers. Fake accounts can be used to mimic or catfish other individuals, as well as offer counterfeit services and products.

We will do the following in this project:

- Understand the theory and understanding of Deep Neural Networks - Understand the applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques in the banking sector
- Import important Python packages, as well as a dataset, and do exploratory data analysis.
- Use Seaborn to visualize your data.
- Separate the data into train and test datasets by standardizing it.
- Create a deep learning model with Keras as the backend and Tensorflow 2.0 as the frontend.
- Using a variety of KPIs, evaluate the model's performance and confirm that it is generalizable (KPIs).
